## Getting Started

This is tutorial for MX_IMU_V1.0.  
It is a fully open-source Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) development board built around the STM32F405 processor, the ICM42688-P IMU sensor.

It is highly suitable for experiment-oriented purposes, sensor fusion research, and prototype development. The package includes the schematic, PCB layout, firmware source code, and a Python MAVLink-based GUI.
