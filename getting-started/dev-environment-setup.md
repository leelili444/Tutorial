# Dev environment setup (for Windows)

## STM32 board devleopment 
* [STM32CubeIDE Version: 1.19.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
* [STM32CubeMX  Version: 6.15.0](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32cubemx.html)
* **Install software packages for STM32F4**  
  ST has created STM32Cube MCU packages for different series of STM32 processors.  The package is MCU specific and contains all the low-level files, which are HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) APIs, LL (Low-layer) APIs, ARM Cortex-M CMSIS files, BSP (Board Support Package) files, additional utilities and drivers. User can also deploy FreeRTOS in the project.
  
  MX Motion IMU uses the STM32F405 processor, so after the installation of STM32CUbeIDE, the STM32CubeF4 MCU package is also needed.  Go to Help->STM32Cube Updates->connection to myST, and enter your password to login with ST account.  Then go to Help->Configuration Tool->Manage Embedded Software Packages. A new window with title ‘Embedded Software Packages Manager’ will popup.
  
  Select the ‘STM32Cube MCU Packages’ tab in the top, and find the ‘STM32F4’ series.
  The latest version is 1.28.3.

## Python environment
* [Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Windows-x86_64](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/new-release-anaconda-distribution-2025-06)
* PyCharm comes along with Anaconda3. Using PyCharm, the following libraries need to install:
  * Pyqt6  
  a set of Python bindings for the cross-platform Qt application framework, used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
  * [PyMAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/mavgen_python/)  
  a low level and general purpose MAVLink message processing library.

## Source code management
* install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
* download code from [MX Motion IMU repo](https://github.com/leelili444/IMU)
